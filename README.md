## PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
The project is basically a website that allows one to order a pizza online by choosing the name, size, crust, topping, then place an order and see the charge at the end of the transaction, with another option of choosing as many pizzas as one wants, hence being very convenient. :satisfied:
